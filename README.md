# front-end project: e-Store

This is my project implementation for a digital store. In this web app, you can:

- Find products.
- Click the product and read the details of the product.
- Filter the products by brand, type, price, and favorites.
- Every product is displayed on an elegant card.
- Every product card contains the name of the product and buttons to add to the shopping cart and to add to favorites.
- The eStore contains a button in the navbar to go to the shopping cart page and checkout if wanted.
